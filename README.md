You're already that smart. 

## What is retrieval.ist?

A tool to help you **find what you don't know you know**. With the arrival of
ChatGPT, our fears of losing our jobs and becoming useless are getting to our 
bones. But fear not! No ChatGPT will ever outsmart those who use the power of
artificial intelligence to their advantage. retrieval.ist is a tool to help you
find what you don't know you already know thanks to the versatile capabilities
of generative artificial intelligence. It uses "retrieval-augmented generation"
to help you find the information you already have to create massive value.

## What's this repository?

A proof-of-concept made with Python, Zotero, ChromaDb, and Ollama. It uses the
Mistral-7b LLM to generate "embeddings" of your documents and then uses them
to retrieve the most relevant information to a given query. That's it.
